Use the Management Center REST API.\nManagement Center can connect to the ProxySG to apply changes. See the documentation on the REST API: Management Center REST API 2. The ProxySG has a number of read-only advanced URL like https://<ProxySG_IP_address>:8082/sysinfo or https://<ProxySG_IP_address>:8082/policy/ \n\nThese are not APIs but the URLs can be used to fetch information about the proxy.  3. The ProxySG's SSH interface can be utilized to make changes in the proxy configuration using the CLI. Using SSH it is possible to script commands for automation. Refer to the CLI documentation: ProxySG Command Line ReferenceProxySG API to gather data and integrate with other reporting products\n\nQ2) Can't the policy be reflected in Excel format instead of XML format in WEB VPM?\n\nCurrently ProxySG do not support the option to export policy to excel format. If you noticed before, in the policy trace, the policy is structured as a line of command which is check one by one with MISS and MATCH status. As ProxySG are built to use multiple layer like forwarding, authentication and access with different format and function, it almost impossible to create a general rule which can fit into Excel row and column. \n\nRegards,\nFauzee---=Part.48e3.4031d86c259b6bb1.19634e26cad.f0d8653e56a1d5b4=-\n\nHi, TeamThank you for your support.I was thinking the same thing about the contents, but I opened a case because of the customer's request.
